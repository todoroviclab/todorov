### Research Interests  
Mechanisms by which anesthetic drugs interact with neurotransmitter systems in the central nervous system to produce pharmacological and toxicological effects.

### Research Description  
>Broadly, my research interests focus on mechanisms by which anesthetic drugs interact with neurotransmitter systems in the central nervous system to produce both pharmacological and toxicological effects. My primary interests thus far have centered on the identification and characterization of neurotoxic properties of commonly used intravenous and inhalational anesthetics with special emphasis on NMDA antagonist class of general anesthetics. It had extended to include several studies that have looked at the pharmacological ways of protection against this type of neurotoxicity. This research is federally funded by NIGMS/NIH and NICHD/NIH.

>Another important aspect of my research is focused on pathophysiology and pharmacology of the neuropathic pain using whole animal models and variety of neurobehavioral tests. This research is federally funded by NINDS/NIH.
